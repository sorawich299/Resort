        <p>2. Analysis tools The tracking measures used by use as specified below are performed on the basis of the first sentence of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. With the tracking measures used we want to ensure that our website is designed to meet the needs of users and optimised on a continuous basis. We moreover use the tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate such use to optimise our offering for you. Such interests are to be deemed legitimate within the meaning of the aforementioned provision. The respective data processing purposes and data categories can be found in the relevant statements on such tracking tools.Web tracking This website also uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. based in Mountain View, USA (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”. These are text files that are saved to your computer that allow your usage of the website to be analysed. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on a server in the United States.Google provides IP anonymisation (so-called IP masking) and this is activated on this website (by extending Google Analytics by the code “gat._anonymizeIp();”); Google will therefore shorten and therefore anonymise your IP address within the European Union or in another member state of the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will a full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and be shortened there.On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use the information collected through Google Analytics to analyse your use of the website, to compile reports on website activities and to render other services related to the use of the website and of the Internet in general to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be mixed with other Google data.You may prevent the setting of cookies by Google Analytics by configuring your browser software accordingly; however, please note that in this case you may not be able to make full use of all functions of

this website. In addition, you may prevent collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google and processing of these data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=com).Furthermore, you can prevent Google Analytics from recording your use of the website by setting an “opt-out cookie” that will prevent your data from being collected during any future visits to this website.The operator of this website also uses Google Analytics to analyse data from AdWords and the DoubleClick cookie for statistical purposes. If you wish to opt out, please deactivate this function via the ads settings manager http://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=de</p>
<p>3. Inclusion of third-party services and content (e.g. YouTube and Google Maps) Third-party content such as videos from YouTube or maps from Google Maps (hereafter referred to as “Third Party Providers”) are included in this website. To use such content, the user’s IP address for technical reasons must be sent to the respective Third Party Provider, since without the IP address the Third Party Providers would not be able to send the content included in the Website to the browser of the respective user. We do not have any control over whether a Third Party Provider stores the IP address e.g. for statistical purposes or otherwise.</p>
<p>4. Social media plug-ins The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you in the form of a user profile and uses the data for advertising and market research and/or to make any required changes in the design of its website. Such evaluation is performed particularly (also for users not logged in) enable ads tailored to user demand and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right to object to the creation of such user profiles. To exercise such right, you must contact the plug-in provider by following the procedure as set out below. Through plug-ins we offer you the possibility of interacting with social networks and other users. In that way we can improve our offering and make it more attractive for you as a user. The legal basis for the user of plug-ins is the first sentence of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.Data are disclosed regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and have logged

in there. If you are logged in to the plug-in provider, your data collected from us are allocated directly to the account you hold with the plug-in provider. If you click on the activated button and e.g. link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and publicly discloses it to your contacts. As a rule, we recommend logging off after using a social network, especially, though, before activating the button, since that allows you to avoid your data being allocated with your profile with the plug-in provider.Facebook The website uses social plug-ins (hereafter referred to as “plug-ins”) for the social network facebook.com, which is run by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (hereafter referred to as “Facebook”). The plug-ins display one of the Facebook logos (white “f” on blue tile or “thumbs up” symbol) or are designated with the comment “Facebook social plug-in”. A list and display of Facebook social plug-ins is available here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.When a user accesses a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, his/her browser establishes a direct link to the servers of Facebook. The content of the plug-in will be transmitted from Facebook directly to the user’s browser, which will integrate it into the web page. The provider therefore has no control over the extent of data which Facebook collects through this plug-in. Based on the Provider’s most recent knowledge, Facebook proceeds as follows:By imbedding of the plug-ins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the respective web page of the Provider’s website. If the User is logged in to Facebook, Facebook may allocate the visit to the user’s Facebook account. If users interact with the plug-ins, for instance by clicking the “Like” button or leaving a comment, this information will be sent from the user’s browser directly to Facebook where it will be stored. If a user is not a Facebook member, there is still a possibility that Facebook will register and store this user’s IP address.For details on the purpose and scope of the data collection and further processing and use of the data by Facebook and users’ rights and configuration options to protect their privacy, users are advised to refer to the privacy information of Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.If a user is a Facebook member and does not wish Facebook to collect data about him/her via the Provider’s website and to link this to the user’s member data stored at Facebook, the user must log out of Facebook before visiting the provider’s website.</p>
