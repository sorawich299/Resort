A list and display of Facebook social plug-ins is available here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.When a user accesses a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, his/her browser establishes a direct link to the servers of Facebook. The content of the plug-in will be transmitted from Facebook directly to the user’s browser, which will integrate it into the web page. The provider therefore has no control over the extent of data which Facebook collects through this plug-in. Based on the Provider’s most recent knowledge, Facebook proceeds as follows:By imbedding of the plug-ins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the respective web page of the Provider’s website. If the User is logged in to Facebook, Facebook may allocate the visit to the user’s Facebook account. If users interact with the plug-ins, for instance by clicking the “Like” button or leaving a comment, this information will be sent from the user’s browser directly to Facebook where it will be stored. If a user is not a Facebook member, there is still a possibility that Facebook will register and store this user’s IP address.For details on the purpose and scope of the data collection and further processing and use of the data by Facebook and users’ rights and configuration options to protect their privacy, users are advised to refer to the privacy information of Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.If a user is a Facebook member and does not wish Facebook to collect data about him/her via the Provider’s website and to link this to the user’s member data
